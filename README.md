# unstash
a quick and dirty tumblr theme bc i was sick of customising someone else's one

this is literally a one-night job, don't @ me

### todo

[] custom toggle showing photo captions, titles and tags on index page
[] research how to make css grid rows break naturally whilst keeping columns (might end up needing flexbox, hmm)
[] typography still needs work
[] support other post types
